# Matrix-Multiplication-Calculator

Hello, I'm excited to present the Matrix Multiplication Calculator Web App that I've developed. This app allows users to input the dimensions of two matrices and calculates their multiplication. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it dynamically generates input fields for the matrix elements based on the user inputs.
